# A DevSecOps Project: Github-Actions -  Credential Leakage Detection
Mini DevSecOps Project

GitHub Actions operates through automated pipelines that execute predefined tasks. Each pipeline consists of modular components called jobs, which handle specific functions in sequence. These pipelines trigger automatically; responding to code changes, repository events like pull requests, or even operating on fixed timetables.
This project uses GitHub Actions to implement automated secret scanning (think: exposed API keys, passwords, or tokens).
